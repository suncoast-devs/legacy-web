      "<p><b>Women Developers and Programmers!</b>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Want to learn how to code? Have a great idea? Don't be shy. Develop it!&nbsp;<br><br> It can be intimidating for women to learn and ask questions when they are in an extreme minority. While open and welcoming, today's budding developer community is up to 91% male. There isn't a comfortable place where women can learn at their own pace and not be afraid to ask \"stupid questions.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p> We decided it was time to provide a place where all questions are OK and everyone can learn in a supportive environment. Our courses focus on coding, leveraging existing technology, and having something to show for it (aka building sweet websites).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.girldevelopit.com/\">Girl Develop It</a>&nbsp;is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to providingaffordable&nbsp;and&nbsp;accessible&nbsp;technology classes&nbsp;for women in a&nbsp;judgement-free&nbsp;environment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whether you want to advance your own knowledge of technology for your current job, or are looking to transition into a more tech-minded job, we're here to help get you the skills you need!</p>\n<p>Courses we offer on a rotating basis:</p>\n<p>• Intro to HTML / CSS&nbsp;</p>\n<p>• Intro to Responsive Web Design&nbsp;</p>\n<p>• Intro to HTML5 and CSS3&nbsp;</p>\n<p>• Intro to Javascript&nbsp;</p>\n<p>• Intro to Sass&nbsp;</p>\n<p>• Intro to Web Servers with Node.JS&nbsp;</p>\n<p>• Intro to the Command Line&nbsp;</p>\n<p>• Intro to Git and Github&nbsp;</p>\n<p>FAQ:</p>\n<p><i>\"I'm a guy. Can I come?\"</i>&nbsp;<br>Absolutely! We welcome anybody who wants to learn technology skills, all we ask is that you adhere to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.girldevelopit.com/code-of-conduct\">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>\n<p><i>\"Do you teach kids? / Can I bring my kids?\"</i>&nbsp;<br>Our organization is not equipped to teach anybody under the age of 18. As such, we do not offer kids classes. We cannot teach students under the age of 18, even with a guardian present. Check out the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://genaustin.org/\">Girls Empowerment Network</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://chicktech.org/\">ChickTech</a>&nbsp;for curriculum for children.</p>\n<p>\"<i>Why do you charge for your classes?\"</i>&nbsp;<br>Our instructors are all professionals at the top of their field, and we pay them for their time. Teaching a class, prepping material, slides, and resources is a time-consuming task. For those reasons, we pay our instructors and your class fee ensures our instructors are paid for their time.</p>\n<p><i>\"I don't see any upcoming classes\"</i>&nbsp;<br>That likely means we're taking a quick break between \"course tracks.\" Subscribe to this meetup to be alerted when a new class is added.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i>\"I have a hackathon / event that your members will really like. Can you help promote it?\"</i>&nbsp;<br>Unless we have first hand experience with your event and we are able to attest that your event will be friendly towards women or people just getting started in tech, we cannot promote your event.</p>\n<br>",

      "<p>CoderNight is to practice development. You write code in pairs or individually and submit the code to me. I post an&nbsp;anonymized&nbsp;repo and you have a week to look at all the solutions before a friendly night of code review.</p>\n<p><strong>CoderNight</strong></p>\n<p>CoderNight is a chance to practice your coding skills outside your work environment or help get started if you are just learning. CoderNight provides an ego-free environment to perform deliberate coding practice and to receive critical but judgement free feedback on your progress.</p>\n<p>CoderNight welcomes people of all skill levels from \"I just wrote my first line of code\" to \"I have invented my own language\"</p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>\n<p>We will send out a&nbsp;<em>homework</em> statement a few weeks before the meeting. You'll complete the assignment and submit your code anonymously (you may submit more than one entry). About a week before the meeting we'll start sharing solutions for everyone to read and review. During the meeting, the group will review and provide feedback for the posted solutions. The sole purpose of the meeting is to provide feedback to those who submitted code and ONE guest.</p>\n<p><strong>The homework:</strong></p>\n<p>Each meeting we will send out a challenge problem to work on. These will be non-trivial problems but not impossible to solve. We aren't going to make you solve the Traveling Salesman problem, but this won't be 2+2 either.</p>\n<p>You can work on these problems in a manner of your choosing - individually, in pairs, etc. Code must be submitted before the meeting - 'night-of' submissions will not be accepted.</p>\n<p><strong>Submitting your code:</strong></p>\n<ul> \n <p><strong>Submissions will be 100% anonymous</strong></p> \n <p>For now submissions will be emailed to me (gavin at gstark.com) and I will create a public github repository for everyone's code. NOTE: this is not 100% anonymous since I'll see your email address next to your code, but I'll try to ignore/forget.</p> \n <p>You may submit more than one entry.</p> \n <p>Your submission should also state what you are trying to achieve with the solution provided. Examples include:</p> \n <ul> \n  <p>Just learning to code so I just want this to WORK</p> \n  <p>Learning Ruby, practicing writing with the \"Ruby style\"</p> \n  <p>Trying \"everything is an object\"</p> \n  <p>Golfing (fewest possible number of characters/lines) attempt</p> \n  <p>100% Test Driven (include the tests)</p> \n </ul> \n <p>If you consider yourself an experienced developer and you raced through the assignment, you are \"doin' it wrong\" and should find an area to focus on. You should attempt to solve these assignments using techniques that are outside of your comfort zone. For example, perhaps try \"TDD as if you meant it\" (<a href=\"http://cumulative-hypotheses.org/2011/08/30/tdd-as-if-you-meant-it/\">http://cumulative-hypotheses.org/2011/08/30/tdd-as-if-you-meant-it/</a>) or try to avoid using primitives (eschew integers for objects).</p> \n <p>We will publish a full catalog of submissions with enough time to review them prior to the meetup.</p> \n</ul>\n<p><strong>The meetup:</strong></p>\n<p><em>ONLY</em> those who submitted code for review may attend the meeting.</p>\n<p>Each person who submitted code may bring no more than&nbsp;<em>ONE</em> guest to the meeting. Guests may attend&nbsp;<em>ONCE</em> before being required to submit code in order to attend.</p>\n<p>What the meeting&nbsp;<em>IS</em>:</p>\n<ul> \n <p>A place to get honest, critical, and helpful feedback on your code either anonymously or face-to-face</p> \n <p>A place to ask questions about the positive and negative qualities of many ways to solve the same problem (I guarantee there will be more ways than you'd expect)</p> \n <p>A chance to identify areas of problem solving, coding and Ruby you'd like to improve on. (and perhaps focus on for the next meeting)</p> \n <p>A great chance to help others.</p> \n</ul>\n<p>What the meeting is&nbsp;<em>NOT</em>:</p>\n<ul> \n <p>Grandstanding (\"Look at&nbsp;<em>MY</em> code, I'm the king of the world\") -- I'll kick you out.</p> \n <p>Pick on the noob (\"ZOMG, 200 lines, I could totally do that in 6!\") -- Again, I'll kick you out</p> \n <p>Hard recruiting to hire. Its fine to meet people and see they'd be a fit for your company, but if you use this as a screening process, guess what -- I'LL KICK YOU OUT.</p> \n</ul>\n<p><strong>A few meetings rules:</strong></p>\n<ul> \n <p>You have to submit a solution (or be an invited guest) to attend the meeting. Statler &amp; Waldorf's are not welcome - no \"I'm just here to criticize\".</p> \n <p>You&nbsp;<em>MUST</em> have reviewed solutions and be prepared to speak about them. We are&nbsp;<em>NOT</em> going to read each line of each submission as a group. The meeting only works if you have prepared notes.</p> \n <p>You can be critical, but you must be kind. Otherwise, yeah, you got it, I'll kick you out.</p> \n <p>You must be willing to follow up with people who want to ask questions or for additional detail regarding your comments.</p> \n <p>You may not ask \"Who wrote this anonymous solution?\" -- 100% chance I'll kick you out.</p> \n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why am I doing this?</strong></p>\n<p>I learn by doing. I learn by practicing. I am always coding. I am always refactoring. I also learn by watching and helping others do all of the above. I'm always impressed by seeing how others solve problems and enjoy helping people improve and through that improve myself.</p>\n<p>I understand people can be self-conscious of their code. It sometimes feels like an extension of yourself and you don't want to be criticized by others. This is why the anonymous option and \"be critical but kind\" is so important to the format of this event.</p>",

      "<p>What does it take to become great at something? Hard work, right? Then you might also agree that it takes lots of practice too. This meetup aims to help members become better at coding through code katas. You are now probably wondering what a kata is. Kata is a Japanese term that refers to individual training exercises for practitioners of karate. A code kata, therefore, is an exercise for practitioners of code. A kata, in any sense, aims to help individuals improve their ability through structured exercises. This group strives to do just that for coders who seek to level up their problem-solving skills with code katas from Code Wars, Code Fights, Exercism, and Free Code Camp, just to name a few.</p>\n<p>As a base, we use the Free Code Camp algorithm challenges to start but this group is not limited to that curriculum. Our hope is that this group expands and grows to solve not only other katas found on the web but in other languages too!</p>\n<p>Come one, come all, and let's see how we can improve one code kata at a time!</p>\n<p><b>Find us on Twitter @code_katas!</b></p>",
